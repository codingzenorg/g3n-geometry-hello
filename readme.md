# g3n-hello

That is part of a series of sample applications for [g3n](http://g3n.rocks/), a golang library for 3D manipulation.

That example is basically the original [hellog3n](https://github.com/g3n/demos/tree/master/hellog3n)

The intent is exploration and understanding through the doing process.
